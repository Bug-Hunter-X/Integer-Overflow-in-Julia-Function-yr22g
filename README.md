This repository contains a Julia function with a subtle integer overflow bug. The `myfunction` calculates the square of an integer, handling positive, zero, and negative inputs differently. However, for sufficiently large positive integers, the square can exceed the maximum representable integer, resulting in an incorrect calculation or an error. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this issue using appropriate data types or handling potential overflow.
